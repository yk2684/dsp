>> * Pearson's Correlation: 0.068833970354109084
>> * Spearman's Correlation: 0.094610041096582262
>> Looking at the scatterplot, there is a weak relationship between these variables. This is also evident in the small pearson's correlation and spearman's correlation. The difference between the correlations might suggest some outlier influence or a non-linear relationship. Plotting the percentiles of the variables suggest that the relationship is not linear. Birth weight increases more quickly betwee ages 15 and 25.
