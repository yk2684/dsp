[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies
>> are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the
>> difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in
>> pregnancy length?

>> Calculating the mean for both of the variables, the first babies are lighter by about 0.1 lb than the other babies. The Cohen's d between the groups is -0.089, which is small, indicating that the effect is small. In comparison to the difference in pregnancy length, the effect size for total weight is slightly larger.
